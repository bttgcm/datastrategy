abstract = {The surface water quality monitoring network (WQMN) is crucial for effective water environment management. How to design an optimal monitoring network is an important scientific and engineering problem that presents a special challenge in the smart city era. This comprehensive review provides a timely and systematic overview and analysis on quantitative design approaches. Bibliometric analysis shows the chronological pattern, journal distribution, authorship, citation and country pattern. Administration types of water bodies and design methods are classified. The flexibility characteristics of four types of direct design methods and optimization objectives are systematically summarized, and conclusions are drawn from experiences with WQMN parameters, station locations, and sampling frequency and water quality indicators. This paper concludes by identifying four main future directions that should be pursued by the research community. This review sheds light on how to better design and construct WQMNs.},

abstract = {Concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined in water and muscle of Clarias gariepinus from the Akaki River Catchment and the Aba Samuel Reservoir in Ethiopia during 2016 and 2017. The analyses were performed using ICP-OES. The results revealed that both the catchment area and the reservoir are affected by a high influx of trace metals. From measured values/permissible limits of Cr (0.101/0.05 mg ml−1), Fe (1.47/0.2 mg ml−1), Mn (1.06/0.05 mg ml−1) and Ni (0.06/0.02 mg ml−1) in water samples and Cr (10.66/1 mg kg−1), Fe (66.48/43 mg kg−1), Mn (2.28/1 mg kg−1), Ni (4.93/1 mg kg−1) and Pb (2.79/1 mg kg−1) in the muscle of C. gariepinus, it is clear that values of these trace metals were above the permissible limits. Correlation analyses between trace metal concentrations in the muscle and length and weight of C. gariepinus indicated positive relationships in the dry and negative relationships in the rainy seasons, respectively. There is a necessity to carry out continuous monitoring of trace metal levels in the reservoir to understand human health risks associated with consumption of contaminated fish.},

abstract = {Karoon River, from Gotvand Dam to Persian Gulf with more than 450 km in length and an annual discharge of 11,891 million cubic meters, is the largest river in Iran. Increasing water withdrawal from and wastewater discharge to the river has endangered the aquatic life of this important ecosystem. Furthermore, the drinking and in-stream water quality standards have been violated in many instances. In this paper, a river water quality monitoring network is designed, including determination of sampling frequencies as well as location of water quality monitoring stations. In this regard, two models are developed. The first model is a Genetic Algorithm-based optimization model and the second one is a combination of Kriging method and Analytical Hierarchy Process. The temporal variation of the concentration of water quality variables along Karoon and Dez Rivers are evaluated and the main water quality indicators are selected. Then, thirty five stations are selected and the application of Entropy Theory in calculating the sampling frequency is demonstrated. The results show the significant value of the proposed methodology in the design of monitoring network. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.},

@article{Khalil2011,
abstract = {There are several deficiencies in the statistical approaches proposed in the literature for the assessment and redesign of surface water-quality- monitoring locations. These deficiencies vary from one approach to another, but generally include: (i) ignoring the attributes of the basin being monitored; (ii) handling multivariate water quality data sequentially rather than simultaneously; (iii) focusing mainly on locations to be discontinued; and (iv) ignoring the reconstitution of information at discontinued locations. In this paper, a methodology that overcomes these deficiencies is proposed. In the proposed methodology, the basin being monitored is divided into sub-basins, and a hybrid-cluster analysis is employed to identify groups of sub-basins with similar attributes. A stratified optimum sampling strategy is then employed to identify the optimum number of monitoring locations at each of the sub-basin groups. An aggregate information index is employed to identify the optimal combination of locations to be discontinued. The proposed approach is applied for the assessment and redesign of the Nile Delta drainage water quality monitoring locations in Egypt. Results indicate that the proposed methodology allows the identification of (i) the optimal combination of locations to be discontinued, (ii) the locations to be continuously measured and (iii) the sub-basins where monitoring locations should be added. To reconstitute information about the water quality variables at discontinued locations, regression, artificial neural network (ANN) and maintenance of variance extension (MOVE) techniques are employed. The MOVE record extension technique is shown to result in a better performance than regression or ANN for the estimation of information about water quality variables at discontinued locations. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {In order to rationalize a surface water quality monitoring network (WQMN), it is critical to appropriately design surface water quality sampling locations. This is due to high installation, operational, and maintenance costs for each sampling representative of the whole water system conditions. The main objective of this study was to propose an integrated method to determine the most appropriate sampling points in the Khoy watershed northwest of Iran, where financial resources and water quality data are limited. Multi criteria evaluation method including analytic network process (ANP) and Fuzzy logic were incorporated in River Mixing Length (RML) procedure in order to identify exact locations of sampling points. Based on RML procedure, 15 candidate sampling points were identified to suitably select sampling points based on budget deficiency. Relative weights for 12 criteria and 10 sub-criteria related to non-point sources and surficial rocks as well as criteria of topography were then calculated by the ANP method. According to the obtained results, a new total potential pollution score (TPPS) was presented to prioritize 15 candidate sampling points. Then, the values of TPPS were classified and fuzzified to distinguish real differences between scores. Based on current monitoring stations and budget deficiency, the hierarchy value, and Fuzzy rank, six points are proposed as the most appropriate locations for surface water quality monitoring. Furthermore, four points are identified as the second most appropriate for enhancing a robust WQMN in the study area in order for an expansion plan in the future. The results of this study should be valuable for water quality monitoring agencies looking for an efficient approach for selecting exact sampling locations.},

abstract = {Samples of vegetables, water and soil were collected from four vegetable farms in Addis Ababa to evaluate the extent and trend of metal accumulation in these systems and health risk concerns to consumers. Vegetable samples were digested in HNO 3 and HClO 4, soil samples in Aqua Regia and water samples were pre-concentrated with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) using the chelating agent ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC). All the samples were analyzed for Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb with flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The concentrations of Cd (0.12-1.13mgkg -1) and Pb (0.11-0.89mgkg -1) in the vegetables surpassed the maximum recommended levels. The total metal concentrations in soils were (mgkg -1): Cr, 9.9-22.8; Co, 28.0-47.3; Cu, 25.1-51.4, Mn, 1000-1054; Ni, 16.4-55.8; Zn, 146-149; Cd, 1.4-1.8 and Pb, 22.0-50.7. The trace metals Cd, Co, Cu, Mn and Ni in most of the water samples collected from Goffa, Kera and Akaki farms also surpassed irrigation water guideline limits, which might be a case for high accumulation of metals in the soils. However, the soil pH (6.5-7.6) and high cation exchange capacity (CEC), 38.41-50.18, coupled with high clay content, 37-51{\%}, of the soil seemed to limit metal uptake by the vegetables. The physical parameters, pH (7.43-7.89) and electrical conductivity (0.33-1.54dS/m) of irrigation waters measured at 25°C were found within the acceptable range. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Physicochemical samples and macro-invertebrates were collected bimonthly from eight sites established on the Greater Akaki River from February 2006 to April 2006. Eleven metrics representing richness, composition and tolerance/intolerance measures and which were thought to reveal changes along the river, were considered for the study. There was change in macroinvertebrate community structure as one proceeded from the upper reaches to the lower reaches along the Greater Akaki River. The upper reaches were characterized by greater number and diversity of taxa while the middle and lower reaches were dominated by fewer tolerant taxa. Spearman correlation analysis showed that metrics, expected to decrease with perturbation, had strong negative relationship with nutrients and measures of biological and chemical oxygen demand. Among the nutrients, most of these metrics had strong negative relationship with Ammonia. Change in structural organization of macro-invertebrates was attributed to nutrient enrichment and oxygen depletion. The study revealed that raw sewage and solid waste from residential and commercial centres, and runoff from impervious surfaces are responsible for the impairment in Greater Akaki River.},
