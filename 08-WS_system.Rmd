## An example

The findings of the rapid assessment on water quality were visualized using the diagram developed during the Hub assembly in Ethiopia (Figure 4). The natural environment (N) is under stress due to discharges from anthropogenic activities and growing urbanization (axis GU-P-I-N). Low environmental awareness (AW) and a weak governance in implementing existing regulation (G) does not create a sufficient barrier to reduce pressure on the environment. This condition has implie The poor quality or river water and ecosystem has negative impact on population health(N-P) and economic resources (N-R).Low environmental awareness (AW) and a loose implementation of existing regulation does not reduce
