abstract = {Protecting the worlds freshwater resources requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales, from global to local. Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80{\%} of the worlds population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65{\%} of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {A new approach is developed for assessing water security status: the Water Security Status Indicators (WSSI) assessment method. The WSSI has four innovative aspects which address important gaps in the literature. First, it was developed in cooperation with end-users, whose participation enabled the design of a user-friendly assessment method. Second, this method is designed to be implemented at the local scale (small scale watershed or sub-watershed). Third, the WSSI is multivariate: it integrates variables pertaining to water quality and water quantity as they relate to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Fourth, the method provides concrete outputs for incorporation into water decision-making processes. In this paper, we document the WSSI assessment method and its application in a community in British Columbia (Canada), including the incorporation of community input into the development and application of the WSSI, and the integration of WSSI results into community water governance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Water plays an important role in underpinning equitable, stable and productive societies and ecosystems. Hence, United Nations recognized ensuring water security as one (Goal 6) of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs). Many international river basins are likely to experience 'low water security' over the coming decades. Water security is rooted not only in the physical availability of freshwater resources relative to water demand, but also on social and economic factors (e.g. sound water planning and management approaches, institutional capacity to provide water services, sustainable economic policies). Until recently, advanced tools and methods are available for the assessment of water scarcity. However, quantitative and integrated - physical and socio-economic - approaches for spatial analysis of water security at global level are not available yet. In this study, we present a spatial multi-criteria analysis framework to provide a global assessment of water security. The selected indicators are based on Goal 6 of SDGs. The term 'security' is conceptualized as a function of 'availability', 'accessibility to services', 'safety and quality', and 'management'. The proposed global water security index (GWSI) is calculated by aggregating indicator values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using the ordered weighted average method, which allows for the exploration of the sensitivity of final maps to different attitudes of hypothetical policy makers. Our assessment suggests that countries of Africa, South Asia and Middle East experience very low water security. Other areas of high water scarcity, such as some parts of United States, Australia and Southern Europe, show better GWSI values, due to good performance of management, safety and quality, and accessibility. The GWSI maps show the areas of the world in which integrated strategies are needed to achieve water related targets of the SDGs particularly in the African and Asian continents.},

Water vulnerability is contingent upon biophysical and social drivers operating at multiple scales, and is difficult to assess. This paper offers a systematic review of 50 water vulnerability assessment tools. We identify and synthesise the contents of these assessment tools (710 indicators) into five dimensions and 22 sub-dimensions and consider the extent to which they reflect environmental and social aspects. The findings are discussed in light of a holistic approach to water resources management, and specifically Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). Significant opportunities exist to enhance the efficacy of water vulnerability assessment tools by incorporating indicators and operational measures for social considerations (e. g., adaptation, institutions, governance) that are developed outside the context of water. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This paper outlines options for the development of a set of metrics for monitoring water security, principally at the level of countries. Multiple definitions have been proposed for water security, reflecting the desire to articulate, in a few words, the objectives of water resource management in general, as well as reflecting interest in other related ‘security' agendas including food, energy, national and human security. This paper does not propose another ‘definitive' characterisation of water security. Rather, it considers existing definitions of water security and related terms, notably water scarcity and risk, to identify the themes in relation to water security that recur in ongoing debate (Box 1). From there, workable options for measuring progress on each component are identified, as a first step in moving from an abstract concept, to measurable policy targets. Outside drinking water and sanitation coverage, which have become the focal indicators for the water sector as a whole due to the prominence of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target 7c, there is little consensus, nor any unified international architecture, for monitoring progress on water security, broadly conceived.},

This Asian Water Development Outlook 2007 report marks an early milestone in the Forums progress. Established only in September 2006, the APWF is a result of the Joint Declaration issued by the Water Ministers of the Asia-Pacific Region at the Fourth World Water Forum, Mexico City six months earlier. It is remarkable that so much information needed for the future management of the water and sanitation sectors in the Asia and Pacific region has already been assembled, analyzed, and made available through this timely report. These experiences and analyses, and the recommendations that can be drawn from them contribute directly to the First Asia-Pacific Water Summit, held in December 2007. The APWF Governing Council expresses its deep appreciation to Asian Development Bank and partner institutions for bringing the regions water supply and sanitation sector issues together in this report. APWF sincerely hopes that this contribution to meeting the present and coming challenges in the water supply and sanitation sector will be found useful to the many public, private, nongovernment, and community-based organizations and interested individuals who share its vision of bringing safe water and sanitation to everyone in the region.

abstract = {Water security has come to assume an increasingly prominent position in the international water and development community in recent years. Staff at the World Bank have explained that water security is critical for growth and development (Grey and Sadoff 2007). The importance of water security for the sustainable development of countries like China has been recognised nationally (Liu et al. 2007). Water security has been at the heart of high-profile negotiations on, for example, a Cooperative Framework Agreement in the Nile Basin (WaterLink 2010). Finally, academia and other development actors have also emphasised the concept (Briscoe 2009). What is missing? Despite the elevated status that the term has increasingly acquired in policy documents and development discourse, the concept of water security remains largely unquantified. There are several benefits to translating water security into numerical terms. First, it can encourage clarity and common understanding of a concept around which there currently exists substantial ambiguity. Second, it can help to foster discussion and debate on scales and thresholds for evaluating the presence, absence or degree of water security. Third, it can help to assess the extent to which the concept is really being achieved on the ground in different locations. In a recent paper we devised an index that quantifies water security at a country level in order to encourage a more concrete understanding of the term (Lautze and Manthrithilake 2012).},

@article{Grey2007,
abstract = {Achieving basic water security, both harnessing the productive potential of water and limiting its destructive impact, has always been a societal priority. To capture this duality, water security is defined here as the availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods, ecosystems and production, coupled with an acceptable level of water-related risks to people, environments and economies. This paper looks broadly at those countries that have achieved water security, the paths they chose and the costs they paid, and those countries that have not achieved water security and how this constrains economies and societies. It defines three typologies: countries that have harnessed hydrology, those hampered by hydrology and those that are hostage to hydrology. It finds that countries remaining hostage to hydrology are typically among the world's poorest. They face "difficult" hydrologies often characterized by high inter- and intra-annual rainfall and runoff variability, where the level of institutional and infrastructure investment needed is very high and the ability to invest is low. This paper seeks to capture the dynamics of achieving water security in a hypothetical water and growth "S-curve", which illustrates how a minimum platform of investments in water institutions and infrastructure can produce a tipping point beyond which water makes an increasingly positive contribution to growth and how that tipping point will vary in different circumstances. As there are inevitable trade-offs, achieving water security is never without social and environmental costs; in some countries these are significant, often unforeseen and even unacceptable. This brief analysis suggests that the only historically demonstrated path to achieving water security at the national level has been through investment in an evolving balance of complementary institutions and infrastructure, but that lessons exist for following this basic path in more sustainable and balanced ways. Insights are provided for balancing and sequencing investments, adapting to changing values and priorities, and pushing down the social and environmental costs. The paper concludes that most water-insecure countries today face far greater challenges than those that achieved water security in the last century and are wealthy countries today. They face more difficult hydrologies and a greater understanding of and therefore greater responsibility for, the social and environment trade-offs inherent in water management. As the costs of poor countries not achieving water security, in terms of human suffering, sustained poverty, constrained growth and social unrest, would be very high, achieving water security is a challenge that must be recognized and must be met. {\textcopyright} The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank 2007.},
