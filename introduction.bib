abstract = {Different water quality sampling practices such as location selection or frequency can inform future watershed management strategies. The objective of this work was to compare water quality sampling strategies based on different weighted criteria to determine the optimal sampling frequency and sampling location for an urbanized, eutrophic, freshwater system. Weekly water sampling was conducted over a 2-year period at five locations for six water quality parameters. This high frequency (HF) dataset was then deconstructed into a lower frequency (LF) dataset to simulate a monthly sampling strategy. Statistical analyses conducted showed that for all sampling locations the LF datasets were not significantly different from the HF datasets, suggesting monthly sampling is sufficient to capture the overall water quality conditions in this system. A multi-criteria decision analysis was constructed for statistical and operational criteria to determine the optimal sampling locations given different criteria weights. Results showed that the optimal sampling location changed depending on the criteria weighting, suggesting that statistical analyses alone would not be sufficient to determine optimal sampling locations in this system. This analysis was then used if optimal sampling location depended on specific water quality monitoring goals. Results showed that the optimal location depends on the particular water quality monitoring goals and that this effect should also be considered in the design of future sampling programs.},

abstract = {Sample locations for large river studies affect the representativeness of data, and thus can alter decisions made regarding river conditions and the need for interventions to improve water quality. The present study evaluated three water-quality sampling programs for Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) assessment in the Monongahela River from 2008 to 2012. The sampling plans cover the same 145km of river but differ in frequency, sample location and type (e.g., river water sample vs drinking water plant intake sample). Differences resulting from temporal and spatial variability in sampling lead to different conclusions regarding water quality in the river (including regulatory listing decisions), especially when low flow leads to concentrations at or near the water quality criteria (500. mg/L TDS). Drinking water samples exceeded the criteria 82 out of 650 samples (12.6{\%}), while river water samples exceeded the criteria 47 out of 464 samples (10.1{\%}). Different water sample types could provide different pictures of water quality in the river and lead to different regulatory listing decisions.},

abstract = {Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 for water and sanitation builds on monitoring frameworks that were developed for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), specifically the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP). Yet, since SDG 6 goes beyond the MDG focus on drinking water and sanitation, it also significantly expands monitoring and reporting responsibilities. The target to improve water quality (Target 6.3) calls for water quality monitoring and data reporting that are likely to pose a significant challenge to countries that lack an established monitoring program. At the same time, redundant burdens may be imposed on countries that already have established programs and report out water quality data to inter- or supranational agencies. In this context, there is a risk that the intention that water quality data should serve as a basis for evidence-based decision making will become subsidiary to the resource-intensive activities of data collection and management. Alternatively, policies could be designed based on historical experience with measures of proven effectiveness, prioritizing policies that could have multiple benefits. Policies could be implemented in parallel with the development of monitoring programs and conventional monitoring data could be complemented by information gained from sources such as remote sensing and unstructured data.},

abstract = {Sampling errors are generally believed to dominate the errors of analytical measurement during the entire environmental data acquisition process. Unfortunately, environmental sampling errors are hardly quantified and documented even though analytical errors are frequently yet improperly reported to the third decimal point in environmental analysis. There is a significant discrepancy in directly applying traditional sampling theories (such as those developed for the binary particle systems) to trace levels of contaminants in complex environmental matrices with various spatial and temporal heterogeneities. The purpose of this critical review is to address several key issues in the development of an optimal sampling strategy with a primary goal of sample representativeness while minimizing the total number of samples and sampling frequencies, hence the cost for sampling and analysis. Several biased and statistically based sampling approaches commonly employed in environmental sampling (e.g. judgmental sampling and haphazard sampling vs. statistically based approaches such as simple random, systematic random, and stratified random sampling) are examined with respect to their pros and cons for the acquisition of scientifically reliable and legally defensible data. The effects of sample size, sample frequency and the use of compositing are addressed to illustrate the strategies for a cost reduction as well as an improved representativeness of sampling from spatially and temporally varied environmental systems. The discussions are accompanied with some recent advances and examples in the formulation of sampling strategies for the chemical or biological analysis of air, surface water, drinking water, groundwater, soil, and hazardous waste sites. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {About This Report This report is the result of seven months of work by a broad coalition of data for development experts, working in consultation with specialists from across the United Nations and academic institutions. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) brought the group together in October 2014, recognizing the need for a clear estimate of the scale of resources required for statistical capacity development in the context of the proposed Sustainable Development Goals and in advance of the Financing for Development (FFD) Conference in July 2015. Given the unique political opportunity afforded by the FFD Conference, this report was prepared within very tight timelines. Figures cited are based on pre-existing, known cost-estimates, or informed but not fully tested assumptions. They give an indication of the scale of resources required but are not intended to serve as a blueprint for directing investments. Administrative data improvements, for example, are crucial for effective governance and service delivery, but have been one of the hardest parts to estimate in this study. More work will be required to refine the exact level of investment for each sector and statistical production method and to identify the most efficient and effective ways to direct investments to build national statistical capacity. Furthermore, in-depth research should be conducted within each sector to identify cost-saving innovations that could be integrated into official statistical production methods over time.},

abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - agreed in 2015 by all 193 member states of the United Nations and complemented by commitments made in the Paris Agreement - map out a broad spectrum of economic, social and environmental objectives to be achieved by 2030. Reaching these goals will require deep transformations in every country, as well as major efforts in monitoring and measuring progress. Here we introduce the SDG Index and Dashboards as analytical tools for assessing countries' baselines for the SDGs that can be applied by researchers in the cross-disciplinary analyses required for implementation. The Index and Dashboards synthesize available country-level data for all 17 goals, and for each country estimate the size of the gap towards achieving the SDGs. They will be updated annually. All 149 countries for which sufficient data is available face significant challenges in achieving the goals, and many countries' development strategies are imbalanced across the economic, social and environmental priorities. We illustrate the analytical value of the index by examining its relationship with other widely used development indices and by showing how it accounts for cross-national differences in subjective well-being. Given significant data gaps, scope and coverage of the Index and Dashboards are limited, but we suggest that these analyses represent a starting point for a comprehensive assessment of national SDG baselines and can help policymakers determine priorities for early action and monitor progress. The tools also identify data gaps that must be closed for SDG monitoring.},

abstract = {Water security has emerged as a major framing template in environmental governance and resource management. The term and underlying concepts have attracted the attention of governmental and nongovernmental organizations, private industry, and the academy in policy and practice. Notwithstanding the palpable rise in its use, a comprehensive understanding of how water security is conceptualized and employed in different contexts around the world is limited. We aim to address this gap, by assessing how water security is considered, articulated, and operationalized in place-based studies. We employ a two-part methodological approach that includes (1) a systematic analysis of 124 articles, books, and book chapters published between 2010-2015 using a standardized coding framework to examine trends and patterns in place-based water security research, and (2) an analysis of the treatment of governance as a subset of this body of research to reveal how water governance is framed and understood in place-based water security scholarship. We find broad diffusion of water security across geographic regions and scales, expansive framing of water security, and evolving approaches to indicator formulation. The narratives around future pathways for governance practices include the promotion of participatory processes, solutions that engage both quantitative and qualitative methods, and a mix of both hard- and soft-path approaches to achieve water security. The persistent diversity in perspectives and applications of water security suggests that scholars adapt the concept to the contexts of the cases they are studying. The variation in how water security is utilized in different regions and spatial scales underscores the importance of incorporating community context in how we understand and employ water security. By empirically assessing the diversity and utility of water-security analyses, highlighting regional differences, and tracing evolving conceptions over time, our research can inform future project design, policy-making, and management from the international to the local levels.},
